Not a huge fan of people I'm not close with being weird or inappropriate towards me on PT. You may get hidden for making me or someone else I'm talking to uncomfortable/annoyed.

# My DNI Criteria: 

-General Criteria, so no basic bigots and no pedos/zoos

-Proshippers, and any other subcategory associated with them

-Radqueers, Xenosatanists, Transid... You've got no safeplace here

-Zionists/Pro-Israel

-Loli/Shotacon, the exit's right over there

-Anti-Otherkin or Anti-Alterhuman, goodbye I'm literally a haunted puppet/doll ‚úãüíÄ /srs

# Thin Ice:

-Simps or fanbases of my fictionkins (ex: Scaranation, Blade simps, pretty much most Coroika simps... etc.)

(Honestly I don't really see the need to add my Thin Ice criteria to other bios since it's common sense not to make suggestive comments towards a fictionkin of a character)

I'm socially anxious half of the time, so I'm sorry if I act a bit weird (distant/detached/aloof/mean) around new people or friends. /srs /g

Respect when my name has any DNI variation, I guess it doesn't hurt to ask to INT if I'm on DNI/IWC but don't lose your hopes either.

Usually comfortable with C+H, unless I'm already sitting with friends or on DNI.

There should be links to my strawpage and pronouns card if you wanna know more. I experiment with my pages and sites from time to time.

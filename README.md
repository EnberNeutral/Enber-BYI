# Before You Interact (On Ponytown, Summarized)

***18**/**Major**; Often **Offtab** or **~~Afk~~**; Socially **Anxious**/~~Skittish~~ + **~~Low~~ Social Battery***

* *DNI if you're radqueer, radfem/terf, proshipper, groomer, anti-otherkin, or just bigoted in general*

* *Likes sfw interaction, uncomfy with nsfw interaction (jokes are on thin ice)*

* *Feel free to whisper, crown, or say just "Hi" in general, that's okay*

* *(if you're chill, then we're chill :) /gen)*
  

# I block/hide players when;

1. **I'm disrespected by strangers**, sometimes I'll try to discuss it with those I deem "worth my time" but honestly, my DNI is right above and I stated I'm uncomfy with nsfw

* | *hidden status duration; 24hrs to 7days (varies)*

2. **Mentioning things I'd be uncomfy with**, only applies to players I never talked to in my vincinity and I never block people I'm talking to directly (even if you're a stranger)

* | *blocked chat status duration; 24hrs at maximum*

3. **Disinterest with interacting and/or strangers interacting while I'm on DNI**, though I apologize if I do hide you when I'm not interested, I'm not always in the mood to make new friends or have lengthy conversations

* | *hidden status duration; 15mins to 24hrs (varies)*

______________________________________________________________________________

*Generally most **UNLIKELY** to hide or block friended ponytown players, or friends made on Discord; if anything **I'll try to** talk it out cuz y'all worth my time.*

*Y'all are "**somebodies**". /gen*


***I try not** to hide players, without warning, that have stated in their own bios that it would cause them **anxiety**/**paranoia**/**panic**.* 

*Honestly, **~~super~~** understandable. /srs /gen*


*I'm **biased** and **prefer** making friends with people who have the **same interests** as **~~me~~** or have something else about them that just,, idk seems **cool** or **relatable** to me*

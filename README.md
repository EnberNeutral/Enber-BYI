# WIP-(AboutMe)
Enber/Len (main names)

8teen, INFP 4W5, ‚ôê

Not a huge fan of people I'm not close with being weird or inappropriate towards me on PT. You may get hidden for making me or someone else I'm talking to uncomfortable/annoyed.

DNI if you're racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic... Y'know and you get the drill. Also Proshippers DNI either. /srs

I'm socially anxious half of the time, so I'm sorry if I act a bit weird (distant/aloof/mean) around new people or friends. /srs /g

Respect when my name has any DNI variation, and you're definitely allowed to ask to INT if I'm on DNI/IWC.

There should be links to my strawpage and pronouns card if you wanna know more. Most of it is a WIP and I like changing the strawpage to experiment a bit.
